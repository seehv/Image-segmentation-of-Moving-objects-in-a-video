# Image-segmentation-of-Moving-objects-in-a-video
An optimal flow can be used for motion based object detection and tracking systems. 

### Requirements in your environment
+ Opencv 4.4
+ Numpy

#### About the porgram
The program flow has been divided into 2 tasks. This has been done to show the difference between the normal object detection and object detection using the motion

Task-1: 
+ Normal object detction by finding the difference between frame by frame. \
How to run the program using cmd for task-1?
###### movingObj –b videofileName.avi

Task-2: 
+ Object detection by using the opencv optimal flow algorithm. \
How to run the program using cmd for task-2?
###### movingObj –s videofileName.avi
